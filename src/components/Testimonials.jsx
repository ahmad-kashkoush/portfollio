    content: "I was Ahmed's mentor during his participation in the Google Summer of Code program where he worked on a project to expand the source control operations of GitLab's Web IDE. I want to highlight Ahmed's remarkable performance during the duration of the program. He worked in the project with discipline and dedication that translated into outstanding results: He was chosen as the Notable Contributor for the GitLab's 18.3 release. Ahmed has so much hunger for growth and knowledge that it inspired me as a mentor. He inquired the reasoning behind my advice and requested additional learning resources for the software development techniques that I referenced. He was receptive to my suggestions during code reviews and was very patient during this process. He communicated often, consistently, and requested feedback about his communication style. All these behaviors demonstrate a precocious professional maturity that allowed him to perform so well in this project. I see a bright future ahead of him and I'd recommend him for any project that require young talent with ambition and disciplined work.",
